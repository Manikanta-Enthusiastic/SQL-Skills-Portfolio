**SQL Skills Portfolio**\

**Overview**

Welcome to my SQL Skills Portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL expertise through a variety of projects and scripts that demonstrate my ability to analyze, manage, and manipulate data using SQL. Whether you're a hiring manager, recruiter, or a fellow data enthusiast, I hope this portfolio gives you a clear insight into my skills and capabilities in SQL.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of SQL scripts and queries that I have developed while working on various data analysis projects. Each project is designed to solve specific business problems or to demonstrate my proficiency in different aspects of SQL, from basic queries to complex data transformations.
