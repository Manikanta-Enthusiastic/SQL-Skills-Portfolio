SQL Query for Analyzing Customer Orders
**Overview**
This repository contains an SQL script designed to analyze customer order data by retrieving the latest and second-latest order amounts for each customer. The script uses advanced SQL features such as Common Table Expressions (CTE) and window functions to perform the analysis.

**SQL Script**
The SQL script provided in this repository performs the following tasks:

Create a Common Table Expression (CTE):

RankedOrders: This CTE ranks each order for every customer based on the order date, order_id in descending order using the DENSE_RANK() function.
Retrieve Latest and Second-Latest Order Amounts:

The main query selects the customer_id and computes:
latest_order_amount: The order amount with the highest rank (i.e., the most recent order).
second_latest_order_amount: The order amount with the second-highest rank (i.e., the second most recent order).

**Instructions**
Setup: Ensure you have an orders table in your database with columns customer_id, order_amount, and order_date.
Run the Script: Execute the SQL script in your SQL client or database management tool.
Review Results: The query will output the latest and second-latest order amounts for each customer.

**Purpose**
This SQL script is useful for understanding customer purchasing behavior by identifying the most recent transactions. It can be used for various analytical purposes, including trend analysis, customer segmentation, and targeted marketing strategies.
